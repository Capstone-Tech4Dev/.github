# Insightify.github
Welcome to 'Insightify' a Women Techsters Fellowship (WTF) C24 Capstone project. WTF is a transformative 1-year virtual learning program that empowers fellows with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in the tech industry.
# Purpose
The purpose of the project is to build “Insightify”, a comprehensive  psychometric testing web app tailored to the curriculum of the WTF. This platform will enable the fellowship to properly evaluate potential fellow’s innate attributes and provide good insight into each person’s strengths and areas for development, this helps the fellowship to place potential fellows into most suitable learning track and ultimately maximize the effectiveness of the fellowship,resources and enhance fellows’  overall learning outcomes and career trajectories.
# Objectives
To successfully build Insightify,  these are the identified objectives:

1. Gather data, analyze and define identifiable psychometric traits to be measured and their implications on the nine career tracks of the Women Techsters Fellowship curriculum.
Product Design
Product Management
Cyber security
Software development (Front end)
Software development (Back end)
3D Animation
Mobile app Dev
Data Science
Blockchain

2. Build an interactive testing interface that provides an intuitive and user-friendly platform for potential fellows  to complete psychometric assessment online. 

3. Build an AI Model that uses machine learning to automatically score psychometric assessments and generate detailed reports after analyzing participants' performance across five dimensions:
Cognitive
Personality
Creativity and innovation 
Aptitudes 
Skills and interests
This includes providing insights into their unique strengths,potential areas for improvement and suitable learning track and providing personalized learning recommendations and guidance for participants

4. Establish robust data privacy and security measures to protect participants' sensitive information and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

5. Securely collect, store and deliver organized and insightful reports to the Women Techsters Fellowship on the effectiveness and impact of the psychometric assessment platform within the Women Techsters Fellowship program. This involves analyzing participants feedback, recommended tracks and preferred tracks matches and mismatches, learning outcomes, and long-term career trajectories.
